Successfully updated the system to give Phó Công An Xã (Deputy) the same level of access as Trưởng Công An Xã (Team Leader) for viewing and managing incoming/outgoing documents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Incoming Document Controller (`backend/controllers/incoming_document_controller.go`)

#### GetIncomingDocuments Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only see documents where they were drafter, approver, or creator
- **After**: Phó Công An Xã can now see ALL documents (same as Trưởng Công An Xã, Secretary, Admin)

```go
// Updated role-based filtering
switch userRole.(string) {
case models.RoleSecretary, models.RoleAdmin, models.RoleTeamLeader, models.RoleDeputy:
    // Can see all documents
case models.RoleOfficer:
    // Can see documents where they have related tasks
    query = query.Joins("JOIN tasks ON tasks.incoming_document_id = incoming_documents.id").
        Where("tasks.assigned_to_id = ?", userID)
}
```

#### UpdateIncomingDocument Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only update documents where they were drafter, approver, or creator
- **After**: Phó Công An Xã can now update ANY document (same as Trưởng Công An Xã, Secretary, Admin)

#### DeleteIncomingDocument Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only delete documents created by them or where they were drafter/approver
- **After**: Phó Công An Xã can now delete ANY document (same as Trưởng Công An Xã, Secretary, Admin)

### 2. Outgoing Document Controller (`backend/controllers/outgoing_document_controller.go`)

#### GetOutgoingDocuments Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only see documents where they were drafter, approver, or creator
- **After**: Phó Công An Xã can now see ALL documents (same as Trưởng Công An Xã, Secretary, Admin)

```go
// Updated role-based filtering
switch userRole.(string) {
case models.RoleSecretary, models.RoleAdmin, models.RoleTeamLeader, models.RoleDeputy:
    // Can see all documents
case models.RoleOfficer:
    // Can see documents where they are drafter or creator
    query = query.Where("drafter_id = ? OR created_by_id = ?", userID, userID)
}
```

#### UpdateOutgoingDocument Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only update documents where they were drafter, approver, or creator
- **After**: Phó Công An Xã can now update ANY document (same as Trưởng Công An Xã, Secretary, Admin)

#### DeleteOutgoingDocument Function
- **Before**: Phó Công An Xã could only delete documents created by them or where they were drafter/approver

## Security Considerations

### Maintained Security:

3. **Database query filtering** still applies for Officers
4. **Audit logging** still captures all actions

### Improved Access:
1. **Deputy users** now have appropriate management access
2. **Workflow efficiency** improved for document processing
3. **Role hierarchy** properly reflects organizational structure

## Frontend Compatibility

The frontend components already support the role-based access controls:
- Navigation menus show correct options for Deputy role
- Document management pages will display full lists
- Action buttons will be available for Deputy users
- No frontend changes required

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases for Phó Công An Xã:
1. **Document Viewing**: Verify can see all incoming/outgoing documents
2. **Document Editing**: Verify can edit any document
3. **Document Deletion**: Verify can delete any document
4. **Navigation**: Verify all menu items are accessible
5. **Search & Filter**: Verify full search capabilities work

### Regression Tests:
1. **Other Roles**: Verify no access changes for other roles
2. **Security**: Verify authentication still works properly
3. **Performance**: Verify no performance impact on queries

## Database Impact

No database schema changes required. The changes are purely in the application logic layer:
- Role-based filtering modified in controllers
- No migration needed
- No data changes required

## Summary

✅ **Successfully implemented**: Phó Công An Xã now has the same document access as Trưởng Công An Xã
✅ **Security maintained**: All other role permissions unchanged
✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved
✅ **Frontend ready**: UI components already support the changes
✅ **Production ready**: Code is compiled and error-free

The fix ensures that Phó Công An Xã users can effectively manage and oversee all document workflows, providing the necessary authority for their supervisory role while maintaining the security and integrity of the document management system.

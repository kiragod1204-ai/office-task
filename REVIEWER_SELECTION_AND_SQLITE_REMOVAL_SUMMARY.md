# Summary: Reviewer Selection Enhancement and SQLite Removal

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. SQLite Removal from Backend
- **Removed**: `backend/database/database_alternative.go` - SQLite alternative database initialization
- **Updated**: `backend/go.mod` - Removed `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` dependency
- **Verified**: No remaining SQLite references in Go files, shell scripts, or batch files
- **Tested**: Backend builds successfully without SQLite dependencies

### 2. Reviewer Selection Functionality Verification
The reviewer selection functionality was already fully implemented and working correctly:

#### Frontend Implementation (TaskManagementActions.tsx)
- âœ… **Search Functionality**: Users can search reviewers by name, role, or username
- âœ… **Role Filtering**: Only shows Team Leaders and Deputies as potential reviewers
- âœ… **Selection UI**: Interactive cards with visual selection indicators
- âœ… **Notes Support**: Officers can add notes when selecting reviewers
- âœ… **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows selected reviewer details before confirmation
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback

#### Backend Implementation (task_controller.go)
- âœ… **ChooseReviewer Endpoint**: `/tasks/:id/choose-reviewer` - Officers can select specific reviewers
- âœ… **GetAvailableReviewers Endpoint**: `/tasks/reviewers/available` - Gets list of eligible reviewers
- âœ… **SubmitForReview Endpoint**: `/tasks/:id/submit-review` - Auto-assigns reviewer
- âœ… **ReworkTask Endpoint**: `/tasks/:id/rework` - Send task back for rework
- âœ… **Role Validation**: Only Team Leaders and Deputies can be reviewers
- âœ… **Permission Checks**: Only officers can choose reviewers for their assigned tasks
- âœ… **Status History**: Tracks all reviewer selection actions

#### API Integration (frontend/src/api/tasks.ts)
- âœ… **Complete API Coverage**: All reviewer selection endpoints implemented
- âœ… **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all requests/responses
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all API calls

### 3. Database Configuration
- âœ… **PostgreSQL Only**: Application now uses PostgreSQL exclusively
- âœ… **Connection Success**: Database initialization works correctly
- âœ… **Migration Support**: All database migrations function properly
- âœ… **Build Verification**: Backend compiles and builds without issues

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of Reviewer Selection

### For Officers (CÃ¡n bá»™)
1. **Choose Specific Reviewer**: Select between available Team Leaders and Deputies
2. **Search and Filter**: Find reviewers quickly with search functionality
3. **Add Notes**: Include context or instructions for the reviewer
4. **Submit for Review**: Auto-assign to appropriate reviewer if no specific choice
5. **Request Rework**: Send tasks back if review requires changes

### For Reviewers (Team Leaders/Deputies)
1. **Receive Review Requests**: Get notifications when tasks are assigned for review
2. **View Task Context**: See all task details and officer notes
3. **Approve/Reject**: Review completed work and provide feedback

### System Features
1. **Role-Based Access**: Proper permissions enforced at API level
2. **Status Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all reviewer actions
3. **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing task workflow
4. **Real-time Updates**: Task status updates immediately when reviewers are selected

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Uses existing `tasks` table with `assigned_to_id` field for reviewer assignment
- `TaskStatusHistory` table tracks all reviewer selection actions
- No schema changes required - leverages existing relationships

### API Security
- JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- Role-based middleware ensures proper access control
- Input validation and sanitization on all requests

### Frontend UX
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Loading states and error messages for better user experience
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- Vietnamese language support throughout

## ðŸš€ Testing Results

### Backend Tests
- âœ… **Build Success**: Application compiles without SQLite dependencies
- âœ… **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connection established successfully
- âœ… **API Endpoints**: All reviewer selection endpoints respond correctly
- âœ… **Permission Checks**: Role-based access control functioning properly
- âœ… **API Response**: `/api/tasks/reviewers/available` returns proper reviewer data

### Frontend Tests
- âœ… **Build Success**: Frontend builds without errors
- âœ… **Component Rendering**: Reviewer selection dialog renders correctly
- âœ… **API Integration**: All API calls properly formatted and handled
- âœ… **User Interface**: Search, selection, and confirmation flows work smoothly
- âœ… **Field Normalization**: Fixed ID field consistency between API response and frontend filtering
- âœ… **Search Functionality**: Reviewers now appear correctly in search results

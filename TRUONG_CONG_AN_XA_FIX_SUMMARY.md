# Fix Summary: Trưởng Công An Xã Document Access Issues

## Problem Identified
The "Trưởng Công An Xã" (Commune Police Chief) role could not see the complete list of incoming and outgoing documents due to overly restrictive backend filtering logic.

## Root Cause
In the backend controllers, the role-based filtering was too restrictive:
- **Incoming Documents**: Only showed documents assigned to them OR created by them
- **Outgoing Documents**: Only showed documents where they were drafter, approver, OR creator
- **Update/Delete Permissions**: Limited to documents they were directly involved with

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Permission Updates

#### Incoming Document Controller (`backend/controllers/incoming_document_controller.go`)
- **Listing**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can see all documents
- **Update**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can update any document  
- **Delete**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can delete any document

#### Outgoing Document Controller (`backend/controllers/outgoing_document_controller.go`)
- **Listing**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can see all documents
- **Update**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can update any document
- **Delete**: Added `models.RoleTeamLeader` to the case that can delete any document

### 2. Permission Matrix Changes

#### Before Changes:
| Role | Incoming Docs | Outgoing Docs | Update | Delete |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Admin | All | All | All | All |
| Secretary | All | All | All | All |
| Trưởng Công An Xã | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Phó Công An Xã | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Cán bộ | Task-related | Limited | Limited | None |

#### After Changes:
| Role | Incoming Docs | Outgoing Docs | Update | Delete |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Admin | All | All | All | All |
| Secretary | All | All | All | All |
| Trưởng Công An Xã | **All** | **All** | **All** | **All** |
| Phó Công An Xã | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Cán bộ | Task-related | Limited | Limited | None |

### 3. Frontend Verification
The frontend Layout.tsx already had proper navigation access for "Trưởng Công An Xã":
- ✅ Access to "Văn bản đến" (Incoming Documents)
- ✅ Access to "Văn bản đi" (Outgoing Documents)
- ✅ Proper role-based UI rendering

## Files Modified
1. `backend/controllers/incoming_document_controller.go`
2. `backend/controllers/outgoing_document_controller.go`

## Impact
- "Trưởng Công An Xã" users can now see ALL incoming and outgoing documents in the system
- They have full CRUD operations on all documents (same level as Admin and Secretary)
- This aligns with their supervisory role in managing document flow
- Other roles' permissions remain unchanged
- Security is maintained as the role still requires proper authentication

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with a "Trưởng Công An Xã" user account
2. Verify they can see the complete list of incoming documents
3. Verify they can see the complete list of outgoing documents
4. Test create, update, and delete operations
5. Verify other roles (Phó Công An Xã, Cán bộ) still have their restricted access
6. Test that the frontend navigation works properly

## Security Considerations
- The changes are appropriate for the "Trưởng Công An Xã" role as they are supervisors
- No security regression for other roles
- All operations still require proper authentication and authorization
- Audit logging will continue to track all document operations
